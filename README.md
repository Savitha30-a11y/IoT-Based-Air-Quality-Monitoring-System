# IoT-Based-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected to a Blynk IoT Cloud platform to monitor environmental parameters such as Air Quality Index (AQI), CO₂ level, Temperature, and Humidity. The readings are displayed in real-time on a 16×2 I²C LCD and visualized remotely on the Blynk Dashboard.
